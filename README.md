Have you ever wanted to build a delivery app that will 
calculate the shortest distance from each drop off spot?

Now, for those of you who have never heard the buzz word 
Matrix Routing before, it is what we will be using to 
optimise our multiple deliveries by travel time. 

We are going to be using TomTom Map SDK for Web, to show 
us the best route for us as the delivery driver, to drop
 off all three deliveries based on time, taking: 
1. The route into account 
2. The traffic on the roads into account. 
3. The traffic incidents on the roads into account

The final route is calculated using the ‚ÄúRouting API‚Äù 
which by default will do a ‚Äúcar‚Äù‚ÄØ route. But it can do 
more than that. It can calculate the routes for 
motorcycles, vans, trucks or pedestrians! As you can 
image, the results will vary.‚ÄØ
